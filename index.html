	<p>Brian W. Bush is a Haskell software engineer at <a href="https://iohk.io/" target="brianwbush">Input Output (IOHK)</a> where he has been deeply involved in developing, testing, and documenting the Marlowe smart-contract domain-specific language (DSL) for financial and transactional contracts. He prepared and tested the Marlowe validator for its external audit and has explored the application of formal methods to languages such as Marlowe. Brian created tutorials, examples, and developer tools to improve the experience of Marlowe’s users.</p>
	<p>Previously Dr. Bush was a Principal Scientist in Systems Engineering at the <a href="http://www.nrel.gov/ target="brianwbush"">National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)</a>. He led and technically contributed to numerous software- and data-intensive modeling, simulation, analysis, visualization, and decision-support projects. Much of that work focused on the biomass-to-bioenergy supply chain, new infrastructure systems for fuel-cell electric vehicles, and the evolution and implications of renewable energy industries. He was a member of NREL’s Science Advisory Committee and he coordinated NREL’s quantum information science and technology (QIST) activities, including its quantum computing work.</p>
	<p>Prior to his arrival at NREL, Brian was a technical staff member at <a href="https://www.lanl.gov/" target="brianwbush">Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)</a>. He developed computer simulations for complex phenomena such as interacting critical infrastructures and supercomputer hardware architectures. He led teams of approximately one dozen people, and held the position of Thrust Area Leader for the U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security’s Critical Infrastructure Protection Portfolio in its Science &amp; Technology Directorate. At LANL he was a member of its Patent Committee and its Institutional Computing Technical Committee. As a visiting scientist at the <a href="https://ncar.ucar.edu/" target="brianwbush">National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)</a>, he initiated efforts to connect simulations of weather and climate to impact models for energy and infrastructure networks.</p>
	<p>Brian received a B.S. in physics at the <a href="https://www.caltech.edu/" target="brianwbush">California Institute of Technology</a> in 1985 and a Ph.D. in theoretical physics at <a href="https://www.yale.edu/" target="brianwbush">Yale University</a> in 1990, where he was a <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/" target="brianwbush">National Science Foundation (NSF)</a> graduate fellow. He extensively performed and published physics research on ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions and nuclear shape fluctuations. His research interests include statistical physics, symbolic dynamics, information theory, data mining, approximate reasoning, theory of simulation, and visualization.</p>
